# Calculator

I started designing this website with an operational Calculator while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with my coach Gillian Mensah at Get Coding NL.

Changelog for this project:

1. Created the index.html, site.css and script.js file for the project.

2. Added table to index.html creating basic diplay of a calculator. Included display box, operators, numbers, equal sign and clear button.

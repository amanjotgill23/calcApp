# Calculator

I started designing this website with an operational Calculator while learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript with my coach Gillian Mensah at Get Coding NL.

Changelog for this project:

1. Created the index.html, site.css and script.js file for the project.

2. Added table to index.html creating basic diplay of a calculator. Included display box, operators, numbers, equal sign and clear button.

3. Added onClick events for all numbers, operators, equal and clear buttons in index.html. Made display box read-only.

4. Added JavaScript code for all buttons on the Calculator in the script.js file. Included functions for displaying numbers and operators in the display box, clearing the contents of the display box, and calculating and displaying the result of the entered calculation as the output.

5. Added a heading to the webpage and css styling, including color, border and font details.

6. Streamlined the JavaScript file to make the app more efficient and bug free.

7. Added Media Queries to site CSS file for screen sizes of less than 400px.
